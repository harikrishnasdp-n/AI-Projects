# Everything AI
Hi! This is my AI project repository. The individual projects have their own descriptions. 
Currently I am working on two projects. 

1. Recruito: 
An AI based recruiting platform. The platforms now doesn't provide a universal way for people to apply or companies to find the talent. A universal platform powered by AI to support both candidates and the companies. Along with a CV, candidates give their experience information. A few behavioral questions are given. On the other end of the spetrum, companies give the required experience for a particular job, along with the qualities of the required candidate. For example, some people are natural born leaders who can do well in team-head positions. 

When a candidate opens the application portal, he gets the results personalized to him/her. If he has only one year work experience, he gets  only the jobs he can get without needing to 'apply filters' everytime. The same can be extended to the questions like 'if the candidate is willing to relocate'. So far we have managed to optimize many things where AI can simplify the tasks but a universal and trustable recruting platform is yet to emerge. 

2. AI emotion detection: 
Typing, writing are slow inputs. The simple and basic for us to convey information is by speech, which we are naturally born with. As the AI assistants like Siri are being advanced, they need to understand our sense of emotion in our tone. Though they are doing a good job at understanding the context of our speech, they don't understand our sense of emotion. 'what?' (gentle tone) is different from 'WHAAT?' (high tone). 

As the assistants are combining with our daily lives, they need to understand us just like another human being does. This will be a great step towards the advancements of AI.
